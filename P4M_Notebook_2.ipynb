The body of the function uses the **control statement** `if n%2 == 0:`.  Recall that `n%2` gives the remainder after dividing `n` by `2`.  Thus `n%2` is 0 or 1, depending on whether `n` is even or odd.  Therefore the **boolean** `n%2 == 0` is `True` if `n` is even, and `False` if `n` is odd.\n",

        "There are two limiting factors, which we study in more detail later.  These are **time** and **space** (your computer's memory space).  As the loop of `is_prime` goes on and on, it might take your computer a long time!  If each step of the loop takes only a nanosecond (1 billionth of a second), the loop would take about a second when executing `is_prime(1000000001)`.  If you tried `is_prime` on a much larger number, like `is_prime(2**101 - 1)`, the loop would take longer than the lifetime of the Earth.\n",

        "The other issue that can arise is a problem with *space*.  In Python 3.x, the `range(2,n)` cleverly *avoids* storing all the numbers between `2` and `n-1` in memory.  It just remembers the endpoints, and how to proceed from one number to the next.  In the older version, Python 2.x, the range command `range(2,n)` would have tried to store the entire list of numbers `[2,3,4,...,n-1]` in the memory of your computer.  Your computer has some (4 or 8 or 16, perhaps) gigabytes of memory (RAM).  A gigabyte is a billion bytes, and a byte is enough memory to store a number between 0 and 255.  (More detail about this later!).  So a gigabyte will not even hold a billion numbers.  So our `is_prime` function would have led to memory problems in Python 2.x, but in Python 3.x we don't have to worry (for now) about space."

Example:  `thrarity(31)` should output `throdd` and `thrarity(44)` should output `thrugly`.

Use numpy to compute the logarithm, by using the command `from numpy import log` in a separate cell.  Approximate $\\gamma(n)$ as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$.
